## Decision Tree & Random Forest Classifier:

The Ionosphere Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts. Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number. There were 17 pulse numbers for the system. Instances in this database are described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic signal. "Good" (g) radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "Bad" (b) returns are those that do not; their signals pass through the ionosphere. This will be a binary classificstion. Both the Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier willl be employed to evaluate the classification performance. Both classifiers will be compared to determine which performed the best by recording the results of their Confusion matrix, sensitivity, specifity, total accuracy, F1-score, ROC and AUC scores. 5-Fold cross validation will also be employed to determine if the both models better.
